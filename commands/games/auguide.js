            description: `**Crewmates**
            Crewmates win by performing simple tasks around the map, or by ejecting all the impostors.

            âœ… Complete your tasks
            âœ… Don't ignore sabotage events
            âœ… Check cameras, door logs, and vitals
            âœ… Observe visual tasks
            âœ… Call an Emegency Meeting if you have discovered vital information
            
            **Impostors**
            Impostors win by killing Crewmates and evading ejections until only a few Crewmates remain.

            âœ… Unlike Crewmates, you can travel with vents
            âœ… Look busy. Have backup tasks in mind to help you blend in
            âœ… Sabotage Crewmates by switching off lights, breaking the Reactor, and sealing doors.
            âœ… Watch out for cameras
            âœ… Report bodies to gain the trust of Crewmates
            âœ… Work with other Impostors
            
            **Dead Bodies**
            When a body is found and reported, it'll pull all players into a meeting for a discussion. Players can then vote on who they think potential impostors are, or skip the vote if they're unsure.`,
